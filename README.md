# Game-Off-2020

[Game Off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020) is an annual game jam, where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme. Participate individually, or as a team. Use whatever game engines, libraries, and languages you like.

The theme for this year’s Game Off is **MOONSHOT**.

Our team initially consists of 4 members:
-   **Adam Shi Chen**: Music Composing
-   **Cypress Bolan Li**: Art Design
-   **Jazor Jiehao He**: Game Development
-   **Rhoda Honglin Du**: Art Design


## Concept: Moon Heist

The player is sent to the Moon and is in charge of the latest space project: ***The International Moon Base***, funded by the ***International Space association*** (transient name). The player is also secretly employed by a giant science/technology company ***Tesla***, which secretly demanded the player to construct a hidden secondary moon base, and its final attempt is to steal the moon for unknown reason.
